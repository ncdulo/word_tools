# Pull Request labeler configuration
# Not to be confused with `labels.yml` which contains the actual labels
#
# Format:
# [label_name]:
#   - [file paths/globs]

# Note: There are no rules for the main source files!
# This is intended, for now. Consideration will be given on how to
# handle these as we determine how everything is working together.
# I may set up a generic rule to apply a 'triage' label to everything
# not labeled by our rules.
